#Erasing data on SCSI3 (0, 0, 0), partition #5 (sda)
#The installer is now overwriting SCSI3 (0, 0, 0), partition #5 (sda) with random data to prevent meta-infomation leaks from the enrypted volume. This step may be skipped by cancelling this action, albeit at the expense of a slight reduction of the quality of the encryption.
